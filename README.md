- 👋 Hi, I’m Carolina Insaurralde
- 👀 I’m interested in creating different web pages, correcting their code and being able to improve myself day by day
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to work with React and javascript. Before this I saw
 HTML, CSS, DOM, and Jquery. Taking courses, reading books, solving different exercises. I think the best way to learn is by having a constant education.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on companies that are dedicated to the design and development of web pages
- 📫 How to reach me?  My linkedin profile is in the following link. https://www.linkedin.com/in/insaurralde-carolina/
